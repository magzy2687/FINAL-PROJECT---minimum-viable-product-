AttackTrack is an information-sharing application designed to help protect civilians and military personnel from ISIS attacks throughout Iraq.


When locals and military forces can sign up with their phone number, they can send attack reports and receive messages of nearby attacks via SMS. The rapid collection of real-time open source reports provides time for potential ISIS victims in the area to respond to imminent danger.


Furthermore, collected data can be used for a more comprehensive analysis of ISIS's movements throughout the nation.


Attack Track eliminates elements of surprise and has the power to save hundreds of innocent lives.
